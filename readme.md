To launch copy config.json_ to config.json and change:

- token - to the token of your Telegram bot there (you get it from the Botfather)
- target_chat_id - to your user id

Then run `npm start`

If you don't know your user id either try https://telegram.me/userinfobot or send /chatid to this bot once started.
